# Just my Alacrity.yml config 📦

## About ⚡

This is my basic configuration of my **Alacritty terminal**.

Since the file can grow, or also that I like to test things,
I want to have a backup version which if it works correctly

## Usage

## Linux 🐧

Clone the repository inside some folder like `~/Downloads`
Or whichever is your preference

And copy the file inside the folder

```
~/.config/alacritty/<copy here>
```

## Windows 💻

The same way just clone the repository don't download the **.zip** file and copy or cut the **.yml** file into the following path

```
%APPDATA%\Roaming\alacritty\alacritty.yml
```
